## What is GPT-OSS-20B and Why It Matters {#what-is-gpt-oss-20b}

GPT-OSS-20B represents OpenAI's first major open-weight model release since GPT-2 in 2019. This groundbreaking 20-billion parameter model delivers near-GPT-4 performance while running efficiently on consumer hardware with just 16GB of memory.

### Key Features of GPT-OSS-20B:

- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture**: Only 3.6B parameters active per token
- **Native MXFP4 Quantization**: Enables efficient deployment on RTX 50+ series GPUs
- **128K Context Length**: Handle long documents and complex conversations
- **Configurable Reasoning Levels**: Low, medium, and high reasoning modes
- **Apache 2.0 License**: Completely free for commercial use
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Built-in tool use, function calling, and structured outputs

### Performance Benchmarks:

| Model | Parameters | Memory Required | Performance vs o3-mini |
|-------|------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| GPT-OSS-20B | 21B (3.6B active) | 16GB | ~95% parity |
| GPT-OSS-120B | 117B (5.1B active) | 80GB | Near o4-mini performance |

## Understanding Docker Model Runner {#docker-model-runner}

Docker Model Runner revolutionizes how developers work with AI models by bringing the familiar Docker experience to machine learning workflows. Instead of complex Python environments and manual model management, you can now:

- **Pull models like container images**: `docker model pull ai/gpt-oss-20b`
- **Run models as services**: Native integration with Docker Compose
- **Standardize AI workflows**: Consistent experience across teams
- **Package custom models**: Distribute as OCI artifacts

### How Docker Model Runner Works:

1. **Models as OCI Artifacts**: AI models are packaged and distributed through container registries
2. **Native Inference Engine**: Uses llama.cpp for optimized local inference
3. **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API calls
4. **On-Demand Loading**: Models load only when needed, automatically unload after 5 minutes
